# IWAD and PWAD APWorlds

Each subfolder contains the following:

- The folder itself contains all the python scripts needed to create an APWorld for Archipelago. You need these if you're generating a game, but not if you're playing one.
- The "defs" folder contains a JSON file that must be added to the "defs" folder of APDoom-PWAD.
- For PWADs, a "wads" folder may be present, containing additional wad files that must be downloaded to play the game.
